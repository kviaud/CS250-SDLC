How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A user needs are essentially their requirements. Not only listening to what they are requesting but also asking them questions to ensure all stakeholders are in agreement. The initial users stories of a project are put together by the Product Owner, these stories document the customer requirements and are ordered based upon priortization.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When first developing a program, time is spent putting together things such as pseudo code and workflows. To better track this sort of work in Jira, I plan to use Spike user stories. This helps allocate time towards research and planning before any actual coding.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Someone who buys into the team, not literally but whom beleives in what the team is looking to achieve. Accountable, actively supports things such as peer review and on-call. Pair programmming, willing to work with others to limit risk as well as cross train less senior staff. Someone who shares lessons learned and prior experiences. Treats others with respect.
